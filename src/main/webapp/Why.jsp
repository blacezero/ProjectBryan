<h3>Why Is Cybersecurity so important</h3>
<div class ="container">
The importance of cyber security comes down to the desire to keep information, data, and devices private and safe. 
In today's world, people store vast quantities of data on computers and other internet-connected devices. 
Much of which is sensitive, such as passwords or financial data.
<br>
<br>
If a cybercriminal was to gain access to this data, they could cause a range of problems. 
They could share sensitive information, use passwords to steal funds, or even change data so that it benefits them in some way.
<br>
<br>
Companies need cyber security to keep their data, finances, and intellectual property safe. 
Individuals need it for similar reasons, although intellectual property is less of a factor, and 
there is a higher risk of losing important files, such as family photos. 
<br>
<br>
In the case of public services or governmental organizations, cyber security helps ensure that the community can continue to rely 
on their services. For example, if a cyber attack targeted a power plant, 
it could cause a city-wide blackout. If it targeted a bank, it could steal from hundreds of thousands of people.

<h3>Benefits of cyber security</h3>
<div class ="container">
By implementing security, businesses and individuals can protect themselves against the full range of cyber security threats 
outlined below, as well as the numerous others that exist. 
<br>
<br>
With cyber security, companies do not have to worry about unauthorized users accessing their network or data. It helps them protect both their end users and their employees. 
<br>
<br>
Even in those rare cases that security does not prevent an attack or breach, 
it improves the recovery time afterward. In addition companies will often notice that customers and developers are more 
confident in products that have strong cyber security solutions in place.

<h3>The Diffrent Types Of Cyber Threats</h3>
<div class ="container">
-DDoS Attack
A DDoS or Distributed Denial of Service Attack is when cybercriminals overwhelm a network or its servers by sending too much traffic. This prevents the network from handling valid requests and makes the entire system unusable. It can completely stop organizations
<br>
<br>
-Malware
This malicious software can include computer viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, worms, and any other program or file that can harm the computer. Malware is commonly spread by downloads that seem legitimate or attachments in emails.
<br>
Within the category of malware, there are several types of cyber security threats:
<br>
<br>
-Adware is advertising software that spreads malware.
<br>
-Botnets are numerous computers infected with malware that form a network. Cybercriminals use them to perform online tasks without the permission of the devices' owners.
<br>
-Ransomware will lock data and files and threaten to leave the files locked or delete them unless the victim sends payment.
<br>
-Spyware records the actions of a user, such as gathering credit card information.
<br>
-Trojans are malware but disguised to appear as legitimate software. After being uploaded, they collect data or cause damage
<br>
-Viruses are self-replicating. They attach themselves to a file, then spread through the computer's system.
<br>
<br>
-Man-in-the-Middle Attack
This type of attack involves the cybercriminal intercepting conversations or data transmissions between multiple people. An example would be a cyber attack using an unsecured Wi-Fi network to intercept the data that the victim sends from their computer to the network.
<br>
<br>
-Phishing
This type of cyber security threat involves sending fake emails from seemingly legitimate sources to get information such as credit card details or passwords.
<br>
<br>
-Social Engineering
This type of attack tricks users to break security procedures by using human interactions. Cybercriminals commonly combine social engineering attacks with others, such as phishing, to increase the chances of the victim clicking on a link or downloading a file.
<br>
<br>
-SQL Injection
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. A SQL injection aims to perform actions on data in a database and potentially steal it. It involves inserting malicious code via SQL statements, taking advantage of data-driven applications' vulnerabilities.
